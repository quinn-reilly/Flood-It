This is a game where the user attempts to flood the entire board with the same color. 

The game starts in the top, left hand corner, and squares are flooded by clicking a color of a square adjacent to the square already flooded. 
Users try to beat the game before their moves run out.
Flooding the entire board with moves to spare is how you win the game.
